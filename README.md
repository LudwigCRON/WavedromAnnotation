## Introduction

**WaveDrom** is a Free and Open Source online digital timing diagram (waveform) rendering engine that uses javascript, HTML5 and SVG to convert a [WaveJSON](https://github.com/drom/wavedrom/wiki/WaveJSON) input text description into SVG vector graphics.

[WaveJSON](https://github.com/drom/wavedrom/wiki/WaveJSON) is an application of the [JSON](http://json.org/) format. The purpose of [WaveJSON](https://github.com/drom/wavedrom/wiki/WaveJSON) is to provide a compact exchange format for digital timing diagrams utilized by digital HW / IC engineers.

However, this great tool need either a headless web browser or node to generate documentations. Python being mainstream and cross-platform why not leverage its power?

This version is not a mere copy of the original one. The goals are to ensure the compatibility and to add new features. To name a few:
- long name for nodes for creating edges
- metastability wave
- analogue waveforms (step, capacitive step, slewing, arbitrary waves)

The inputs could be either json, cson, or yaml while outputs would be avg, postscript, and libreoffice draw.

pywave is compatible with pydrom...

...with a slight variation on the group representation...

...aligning signal start and end when phase is used...

...can adjust the text position of edges...

...and represents analogue signals, impulses, and more...

## Architecture

### File Formats
**[WaveJSON](https://github.com/drom/wavedrom/wiki/WaveJSON)**

in json-ml for strict compatibility
```json
{ signal : [
  // clock signal
  { name: "clk",  wave: "p......" },
  // bus data
  { name: "bus",  wave: "x.34.5x",   data: "head body tail" },
  // request signal
  { name: "wire", wave: "0.1..0." },
]}
```
in json if generated by other tools
```json
{ "signal": [
  { "name": "clk",  "wave": "p......" },
  { "name": "bus",  "wave": "x.34.5x",   "data": "head body tail" },
  { "name": "wire", "wave": "0.1..0." },
]}
```
for more human use in yaml
```yaml
clk:
  wave: p......
bus:
  wave: x.34.5x
  data: head body tail
wire:
  wave: 0.1..0.
````
and in toml
```toml
clk.wave = "p......"
bus.wave = "x.34.5x"
wire.wave= "0.1..0."

bus.data = "head body tail"
```
*notice the "signal" vanishes in yaml/toml*
