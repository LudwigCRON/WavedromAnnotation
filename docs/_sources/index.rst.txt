Textual representations has the benefit of being compatible with git versionning and diff tools. And while an image conveys thousand words, it is difficult to list changes in a specification of an electronic project when it comes to protocoles, handshakes, or impact of a digital signal on an analogue IP block.

To address this challenge, Pywave is an utility to transform textual representations of waveforms into images. The textual representations is stored, and the generated image can be displayed.
